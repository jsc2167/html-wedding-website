    <p>There is a hilton on the Syon Park property, which we advise that you stay at on Monday night. You can follow <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/hilton-london-syon-park-LHRSPHI/index.html?WT.mc_id=zELWAKN0EMEA1HI2DMH3LocalSearch4DGGenericx6LHRSPHI">this link</a> to get 15% off of the current room rate. If you have a different discount code you'd like to use (such as the Hilton Honors points or a AAA rate), just be sure to put "Morcos/Caine Wedding" in the comments section for your booking.</p>
    <p>The hotel has guaranteed check-in at 3 pm, although they have said they will do their best to allow everyone in our party to check in by 2 pm. It is a five-minute walk door-to-door from the hotel to the venue, so you should be able to drop off your luggage and get ready at the hotel before the wedding begins.</p>
<h2 style="georgia">How to get there</h2>
    <p>To get to Syon Park on public transport, take the Picadilly line towards Heathrow and get off at Boston Manor Station. As you exit the station, go to the bus stop right in front of you (stop N) and take bus E8 to Syon Lane (stop W). Walk down the narrow brick-lined road to the entrance of Syon Park.</p>
    <p>You can also take a cab or an uber, which should be around Â£30.</p>
    <p>The tube closes at midnight on weekdays, so if you have to get back to London after the wedding, you should plan to take a cab.</p>
